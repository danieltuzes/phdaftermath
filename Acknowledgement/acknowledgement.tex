\begin{acknowledgements}      


I would like to acknowledge all those help and hard work, who helped me to directly or indirectly, starting from my very first teachers in primary schools, high school and university. Special thank you goes to those who helped me far beyond their expected duty, my supervisors István Groma, Péter Ispánovity and Michael Zaiser. God bless Konrad and Margerete Krietsch for their disinterested grandparental care.
